# WeatherDashboard
This is Challenge 06. It is a website that displays the weather for any searchable city up to five days in the future and also stores a brief search history

For this challenge I used a combination of the OneCall API and the Geocoding API to find the location of the user input. I used a fetch request to use the data to dynamically populate the daily forecast up to five days in the future.

I was able to build a seach history bar that utilizes local storage.

I was able to style the website using a combination of bootstrap and CSS.

I was able to build the functionality with a combination of Jquery and JavaScript.

I used moment.js to convert the time fetched from the weather API to a readable format.

The deployed website is: https://natedogg97.github.io/WeatherDashboard/
